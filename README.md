# Python Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing method in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the application is working as intended and meets the specified requirements.

Unit tests are typically written by developers as they write code, and they are run automatically every time the code is changed to ensure that the code is correct and the application continues to work as expected.

A unit could be a small, isolated piece of code, such as a function or a method, or it could be a larger component, such as an entire module or a class. The goal of unit testing is to test each unit in isolation to ensure that it is working correctly.
Python Testing Frameworks

There are several testing frameworks available for Python that can help you write and run unit tests for your code. Here are two of the most popular testing frameworks:

#### unittest

`unittest` is a built-in testing framework for Python. It is inspired by the JUnit testing framework from the Java programming language, and it provides a set of tools for writing and running unit tests. `unittest` is easy to use and comes with the Python language, so there is no need to install any additional modules. Many developers use `unittest` to get started with unit testing in Python.

#### Pytest

pytest is an open-source testing framework for Python that enables developers to write simple, compact test suites. It supports unit testing, functional testing, and API testing, and it has a large community of users and contributors. `pytest` is easy to use and is a popular choice among Python developers for writing and running unit tests.
